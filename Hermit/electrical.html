											<h3>Electrical Requirements</h3>
											<p>
												To meet the goal of having a crab that walks towards you and 
												hides its head into its shell when picked up, we needed the 
												following electrical requirements:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Motors that are powerful enough to move the weight of the crab forward</li>
												<li>Sensors that can tell where a person is</li>
												<li>A sensor to tell when the crab is picked up</li>
												<li>A servo to move the crab's head out of and into its shell</li>
												<li>A way to supply enough power to all of the above</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												The electrical schematic for this system is shown.

											<h3>Motors</h3>
											<p>
												To control the motors, we have a motor shield. The motor shield 
												has a fully-dedicated PWM driver chip onboard that handles all 
												the motor and speed controls over I2C. The Arduino is then able 
												to communicate to the motor shield to apply power in pulses that 
												effectively changes the speed of the motors. If we want the motors 
												to go faster, we drive the PWM output to a higher duty cycle. If 
												we want the motors to go slower, we drive the PWM output to a lower 
												duty cycle. Note that the motors we used are rated for 12V so we 
												used a 12V power supply for them (see Power section).

											<h3>Sensors</h3>
											<p>
												One of our requirements for our crab was to be able to tell where 
												a person is. We accomplished this through Passive Infrared (PIR) 
												sensors. A PIR motion sensor consists of two main parts: a 
												pyroelectric sensing element and a Fresnel lens. The pyroelectric 
												sensing element can detect infrared radiation. Note that human 
												bodies emit heat energy in the form of infrared radiation. The 
												white dome in front of the sensing element is a Fresnel lens. 
												This lens focuses the infrared radiation onto the sensor.
											</p>
											<p>
												We connected these sensors to analog pins on our Arduino that 
												read the signals from the sensors. See the <a href="https://berwinl.com/pie-2021-03/Hermit/software.html">Software</a> section to 
												learn more about how we used them to detect a person.
											</p>
											<p>
												Another one of our requirements for our crab was to be able to 
												sense when it has been picked up. We were able to do this through 
												a phototransistor. The phototransistor is a transistor that responds 
												to light striking it by generating and amplifying an electric current. 
												Therefore, we could use the phototransistor to detect a change in light. 
												By putting the phototransistor on the bottom of our crab, we were able 
												to tell when it has been picked up. When it was on the ground, its body 
												would cast a shadow beneath it, meaning that there wasnâ€™t a lot of light 
												hitting the phototransistor. When it was picked up, the phototransistor 
												could be exposed to the light in its surroundings, meaning that there was 
												more light hitting the phototransistor. By doing some testing, we were 
												able to find a threshold reading that we used to determine of the crab 
												has been picked up. To learn more about how we did this, see the 
												<a href="https://berwinl.com/pie-2021-03/Hermit/software.html">Software</a> section.
