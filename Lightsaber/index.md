# Our Project

Welcome, we are the Lightsaber team of the Fall 2021 Principles of Integrated
Engineering Class. For our Final project we have decided to create our very own
Lightsabers! You can find more about our engineering or design via these links,
or read on below to learn more about the overall goals we had and what we did!

## Project Goals
For our project, we planned to build two replica lightsabers. On the mechanical side,
we expected to have a separable hilt and blade which can be disconnected and
reconnected easily. The hilt itself needs to be at least large enough to hold
our electronics, including a speaker, controller, and enough batteries to power
the saber. The blade was expected to be sturdy enough to be swung around as if
dueling. Our second blade we expected to be an extendable blade controlled by a
button on the hilt. Other goals we decided on but were not detrimental to success
were including a modular hilt, making the lightsaber properly balanced, and
possibly adding a crystal reveal in the hilt.

On the electrical/software side we expected for both lightsabers to possess
visual and sound effects. As well as do there respective launch and shutdown
procedures. For effects we wanted to have multiple characters be available to
the user via a button which would change the

On the electrical/software side, we had to start by speccing out a
microcontroller, sound board, LEDs, speaker, switches, etc. in order to make the
lightsaber react to movement changes and turn the saber on and off.
After this we will have to map out and integrate this into the lightsaber
chassis. Following this we can then begin to program the microcontroller to
react as we expect it to (for example, changing sound based on blade speed and
movement). If we end up having the extendable blade, we will also need to spec
out and program the motors that extend and retract the blade. As a bonus, we may
be able to include themes or character-specific modes to set blade colors and sounds,
though this is essentially a customization element to add on top of the main design.

For this project, we anticipate challenges in the design of the
retraction/extension mechanism, especially in fitting it into a comfortably sized
hilt, and in successfully synchronizing the sound and light changes with actual
movement. We may also have issues in acquiring parts, depending on chip availability.
Our current fabrication plan is to start with 3D printing, which is easier to
prototype with but could be a challenge to do full-scale. As a stretch, once
the design is done, we could use the lathe and mills to make a metal hilt, 
though this may become expensive and time-consuming.
